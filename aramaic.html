  <h1>🔥 Aramaic</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p><i>The language of ancient wisdom, spoken by prophets and kings — the bridge between Hebrew and Arabic.</i></p>

    <div class="fragment">
      ܐܬܐ ܐܢܐ ܠܗܘ ܡܪܝܐ<br>
      “Athā anā leḥwā mārīyā”
    </div>

    <div class="trans">
      “I am the way, the truth, the life.”<br>
      — Gospel of John 14:6
    </div>

    <p>This verse from the **Gospel of John** reflects the profound influence Aramaic had in the **Christian scriptures**, spoken by Jesus and his disciples.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “I will send you out as doves among scorpions.”<br>
      — Luke 10:3
    </div>

    <div class="context">
      <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
      <p>Aramaic was the **lingua franca** of the Near East during the time of Jesus and his disciples. It was spoken widely across the region, including in **Palestine**. Aramaic held a sacred role as the language of the **Old Testament**, and Jesus himself spoke Aramaic, as did many early Christians. The significance of Aramaic is evident in its direct connection to many **biblical passages** and its usage in the **Gospels**.</p>
      <p>Aramaic's script and sound remain an important cultural marker, uniting the **Hebrew and Arabic** traditions while preserving its own unique beauty.</p>
