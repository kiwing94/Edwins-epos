<h2> âœ© The Origins of Names and Sacred Meanings<br>
<br>
**Amorite Dictionary:**<br>
- **Malkom** = King, Leader<br>
- **El** = The Mighty One<br>
- **Elohim** = The Mighty Powers<br>
- **Adon** = Place, Land<br>
- **Yah** = Sun God<br>
<br>
**Corrected Sacred Meanings:**<br>
- **Rafael** = Sun Worshipper (not healer)<br>
- **Mahalel (Ma-ha-lel)** = Movement (Ma), Breath (Ha), Bread/Essence (Lel)<br>

<br>
<h2> âœ© The Divine Family and the Tower of Light<br>
<br>
**Divine Family of Breath:**<br>
- **Helel** = Morning Light<br>
- **Daniel** = God is my Judge<br>
- **Mikael** = Who flows like the Mighty One, separated by oath<br>
- **Gabriel** = Strength of Breath, messenger of clarity<br>
- **Jophiel** = Beauty of the Mighty One<br>
- **Gadreel** = The Enclosure of God (Guardian at the gates)<br>
<br>
**Sacred Myth Reborn â€” Tower of Babel:**<br>
The myth says they were scattered for defying God â€”  <br>
But in truth, they yearned for unity.  <br>
They failed because they relied on their own hands without remembering Breath.<br>

<h2> âœ© Bread, Light, Waters, and Breath<br>
<br>
- **Light**: Awareness awakening, not a fruit, but the slow unfolding of consciousness.<br>
- **Waters**: Constant flow of life â€” rivers, seas, lakes represent evolution.<br>
- **Bread**: Symbol of Nature's essence, life force (prana), nourishment of soul.<br>
- **Breath**: The living tongue of creation, the parasympathetic calming energy, the word behind all words.<br>
